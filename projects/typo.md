# Typoglycemia: "Word Scrambler"
  * see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposed_letter_effect#Internet_meme
  * your program should open up a file, read it a line at a time, and output the lines with the interior of the words (i.e., not the first and last letter) scrambled
  * as an example, if the file contains:
       > Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances
    
    
    your program might output:
       > Cnoersgs sahll make no law reetsncpig an eehtbsansimlt of reiogiln or pthonibiirg the free eeiscrxe teherof or aibngdrig the fdoreem of sepech or of the psers or the rhigt of the peolpe pblaaeecy to aembssle and to ptietion the Govnmneret for a rserdes of gercivanes
